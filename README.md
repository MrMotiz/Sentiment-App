### Project Description

Sentiment Analysis is a project using java framework - Spring Boot. This was a group project, created in less than a 
week, for the MindSwap bootcamp at Mindera. The main goal of this project is to analyse the different types of sentiments 
present in a given text using an external API called "Text Sentiment Analysis App".

After the user writes his thoughts, the percentage of positive, negative and neutral words 
contained in the text is returned. Simultaneously, the application returns the predominant feeling based on the highest 
percentage of the words analysed.


The idea of this project is to create a mental health diary, which can be used daily to monitor the different types of 
thoughts in order to perform a mental evaluation on each user.
